# EPHS-Shades
My most complete app, Shades is a way to send messages to your friends, as well as a way to creat chatrooms or join already existing ones. 
I worked on it as part of my Java final project, and as my iOS App Development final project. While there isn't a huge difference between 
the default Apple Messages and Shades, my group and I wanted to create something that had a practical use. <br>
